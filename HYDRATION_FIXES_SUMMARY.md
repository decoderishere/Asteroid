# Hydration Error Fixes Applied

## Problem
Next.js hydration error: "Server rendered HTML didn't match the client" due to theme system and date formatting inconsistencies between server and client rendering.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Theme initialization**: next-themes was causing class/style mismatches during hydration
2. **Date formatting**: `toLocaleString()` and `toLocaleDateString()` produce different results on server vs client
3. **Dynamic content**: Toast notifications and other dynamic components were rendering differently
4. **Client-side only features**: Components using `Date.now()` or other dynamic values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Theme System Hydration
- ✅ Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` element in layout.tsx
- ✅ Updated ThemeProvider with `suppressColorSchemeWarnings: true`
- ✅ Added proper storage key and transition configuration
- ✅ Enhanced ThemeSwitcher with proper mounted state handling

### 2. Date Formatting Safety
- ✅ Created `/src/lib/dateUtils.ts` with SSR-safe date formatting functions
- ✅ Updated all pages to use `formatDate()` and `formatDateTime()` instead of native methods
- ✅ Consistent server/client date formatting to prevent hydration mismatches

### 3. Toast Notifications
- ✅ Added client-side check in `useToast` hook: `if (typeof window === 'undefined') return`
- ✅ Added `mounted` state to `Toast` component to prevent SSR rendering
- ✅ Ensured toasts only render after hydration is complete

### 4. Component Safety
- ✅ Updated DocumentPreview to use safe date formatting
- ✅ All dynamic timestamp displays now use consistent formatting
- ✅ Removed locale-specific formatting that differed between server/client

## Files Modified
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning
- `src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Enhanced configuration
- `src/components/Toast.tsx` - Added mounted state
- `src/hooks/useToast.ts` - Added client-side guard
- `src/lib/dateUtils.ts` - New SSR-safe date utilities
- `src/components/DocumentPreview.tsx` - Safe date formatting
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Safe date formatting
- `src/app/projects/page.tsx` - Safe date formatting  
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Safe date formatting

## Expected Result
- ✅ No more hydration warnings in console
- ✅ Consistent theme behavior on page load
- ✅ Proper date formatting across server/client
- ✅ Toast notifications work without hydration issues
- ✅ Dark mode toggle works seamlessly

## Testing
The fixes address the core causes of hydration mismatches:
1. Theme class/style consistency
2. Date formatting consistency 
3. Dynamic content rendering consistency
4. Client-only feature isolation

The application should now load without hydration errors while maintaining all functionality.
